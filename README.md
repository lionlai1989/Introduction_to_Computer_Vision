# Introduction to Computer Vision
In the era of deep learning, neural networks have revolutionized computer vision, effectively solving numerous complex problems. However, this remarkable advancement has led some engineers to overlook the essential foundation of computer vision skills predating the deep learning era. Despite the superiority of modern neural network-based methods, I believe that conventional approaches still hold significant potential in optimizing algorithms. To illustrate this, consider the car detection problem. YOLO, a neural network-based method, can swiftly detect cars within an image, surpassing traditional methods. Nevertheless, I propose that incorporating the dynamics of a vehicle into the detection process can lead to even more precise and efficient results.  
In light of this perspective, this repository is my humble effort to reacquaint myself with traditional methods in computer vision, which holds comprehensive solutions to computer vision problems from two prominent courses: ['Introduction to Computer Vision' offered by Udacity and Georgia Tech](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810) and ['Computer Vision' from ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://cvg.ethz.ch/teaching/compvis/).  

## Description

## Getting Started
All the results can be reproduced by following the instructions below.

### Dependencies

### Downloading
* To download this repository, run the following command:
```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lionlai1989/cmake_template.git
