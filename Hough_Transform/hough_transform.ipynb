    "\n",
    "We can observe that every bright pixel in the edge image contributes a vote to the Hough accumulator array. When edges align along a line in the image, these votes accumulate in Hough space, forming a distinct cluster of bright points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first image, there are six evident straight lines, but there are 9 points in the Hough space. This is because horizontal lines correspond to $\\theta = 90 \\text{ or } -90$ degrees. This could pose an issue as the votes are split between two locations. Careful consideration is needed to accurately determine the number of peaks to avoid missing any lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second image, there are four distinct points, which are grouped into two pairs in Hough space. This occurs because one pen has two closely spaced edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important implementation detail in `hough_lines_acc` is that I normalized the Hough accumulator array before returning it. This is crucial because real-world scenarios often involve both short and long lines. Normalizing the accumulator array ensures that the implementation can perform well in unforeseen situations with a mix of short and long lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's essential to acknowledge the potential downside of normalization. In situations where no lines are genuinely present in the scene, this implementation may produce misleading results. Therefore, it's important to use this normalization approach judiciously, considering the specific characteristics of the problem and the expected presence of lines in the image.\n"

    "### Finding Peaks and Filtering Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we can extract a line's parameters, specifically $\\theta$ and radius values, from\n",
    "the Hough accumulator by detecting peaks. To maintain precision, I reset neighboring\n",
    "pixels around a peak to zero, preventing the selection of duplicate lines. However, it's\n",
    "worth noting that this implementation is relatively simplistic. In real-world scenarios,\n",
    "a more robust approach might involve finding the average value of a small cluster of\n",
    "pixels instead of relying on a single pixel for peak detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, since we already know that the object we are searching for is a pen with\n",
    "two distinct edges, we can apply specific constraints to filter the detected lines. For\n",
    "instance, we can stipulate that the angle difference between two lines must be less than\n",
    "one degree, or that the distance between two points in Hough space must fall within a\n",
    "certain threshold. By incorporating these constraints, we can enhance the robustness of\n",
    "our pen detector. However, it's important to emphasize that these constraints are only\n",
